# Project_FlaskApp_Pub

1 To enable the app to function you will need to create a SQL database on your computer named "pubstock_db".
2 Breweries will need to be added to db first, then beers, then kegs.
3 On breweries you can edit the name.
4 On beers you can edit the name, abv, and brewery.
5 On kegs you can edit the fill_level,capacity,cost,price and beer.
6 The app runs in flask on your local host at port 4999.
